ARMA is a lifestyle-driven sports nutrition brand for the action and adventure athlete. They came to Agency73 looking for a robust, yet flexible eCommerce store. We suggested using Shopify based on the requirements:

- Ease of use for the client to monitor orders, revenue, and products
- Ability to integrate a subscription-based model for some of their products
- Automatically fulfill orders and seamlessly connect to their third party logistics
- Out-of-box, lightweight eCommerce solution that is well optimized/built for speed
- Build out 2 separate blogs - one to highlight Arma's sponsors/athletes and another for Recipes and Workouts
- Configure and implement a promo code input option at the store checkout

Once we received the design assets, I was tasked to build out the entire website. Since this store was very customized, I utilized a Shopify starter theme, and then implemented ThemeKit so I could streamline the development workflow.

Not only did I handle the build of the Shopify store, but I also led the project management efforts and led weekly status meetings with the client. Sometimes it can be difficult to handle both development and project management for a client, but they were such a joy to work with, it made my job easier!

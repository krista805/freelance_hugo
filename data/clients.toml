quote  = "**Not only is Krista a talented front-end web developer** but she is also a great team player with a fantastic attitude. During Krista's time at Organik SEO she played a key roll in developing and deploying WordPress websites. She worked hand in hand with the rest of the Organik team to develop custom Wordpress themes, create UX audits, and improve existing client websites. She is also very adept and quick to learn anything that isn't already part of her skillset. Krista would be a great addition to any web design agency or company looking for a talented web designer and developer!"
